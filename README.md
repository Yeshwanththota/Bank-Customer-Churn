# Bank-Customer-Churn

This Jupyter notebook is focused on Binary Classification using a Bank Churn Dataset. The objective is to predict customer churn using various machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost.

The notebook begins with data loading and exploratory data analysis, where the data is inspected for its size, variable types, missing values, and distribution of variables. This is followed by data preprocessing, where categorical variables are encoded and the data is split into training and testing sets.

The main section of the notebook is dedicated to model training and evaluation. Each model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves are used to assess the performance of each model.

The notebook concludes with a comparison of the models based on their performance metrics, providing insights into which model performs best for this specific task.
